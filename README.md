**STEP 1(make a database):**

  export the 'finalproj_itel203db.sql' in your sql database.

**STEP 2(fixing the file and folder structure):**

  make a folder where you'll insert all of the given file in here, and inside it, include the following:
  
  make a folder called 'cruds_functions', and insert all of these files
  
    'admin_info_crud',
    'house_info_crud',
    'interior_design_crud',
    'user_message_crud'
    
  make a folder called 'included_files' and insert all of these files
  
    'admin_homes_navbar', 
    'admin_navigation_bar', 
    'connfigure', 
    'contact', 
    'home_page_bgslidding', 
    'homes', 
    'user_homes_navbar' 

  make a folder called 'modals' and insert all of these files
  
    'admin_change_pass_modal', 
    'admin_change_username_modal', 
    'admin_info_add_modal', 
    'admin_info_edit_modal',
    'house_info_add_modal',
    'house_info_delete_modal',
    'house_info_edit_modal',
    'house_info_picture_modal',
    'interior_design_add_design_modal',
    'interior_design_edit_deisgn_modal'

  make a folder called 'pictures', in this folder, all of the pictures will be inserted in here

  make a folder called 'search_requests' and insert all of these files
  
    'admin_house_info_search',
    'admin_info_user_message_search_request',
    'admin_interior_design_search',
    'home_page_search_request',
    'include_interior_design'

  and don't include this file in any folder

    'design',
    'function',
    'admin_contact_page',
    'admin_home_page',
    'admin_house_info',
    'admin_info', 
    'admin_interior_design_page',
    'admin_log_in_form',
    'house_interior_design',
    'user_contact_page',
    'user_home_page',

  then you can access the admin by adding this in the searching this file 'admin_log_in_form.php', it's default username is "admin" and it's default password is "password"
